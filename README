2. INTRODUCTION
"Battleship" is a console game written in C++. It provides game between user and computer. Computer automatically generates the sea of the game. Then generates and sets ships in the sea. The count of ships is 4. Then computer will ask you to enter the coordinates of the field where can be a ship. Then you will see a message. If there is a ship in that location than output will be "The field was damaged". If there is no a ship in that location than output will be "The field is empty". The game will end if there is no ships in the sea.
